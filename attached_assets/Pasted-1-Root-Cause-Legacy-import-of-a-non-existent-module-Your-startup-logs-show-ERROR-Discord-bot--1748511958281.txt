1. Root Cause: Legacy import of a non-existent module

Your startup logs show:

ERROR – Discord bot failed to start: No module named 'features.ingestion.discord'
But in your repo’s README you only have:

features/
├── discord_bot/      # real-time Discord message monitoring …
├── ingestion/        # message processing and storage services
└── parsing/          # AI-powered setup extraction
There is no features/ingestion/discord folder or module 
GitHub
. Somewhere in your code you’re still doing something like:

from features.ingestion.discord import …
That import must be removed or corrected.

2. Clean up the import paths

Search and remove any references to features.ingestion.discord.
If you need something from the Discord slice inside ingestion, import it from features/discord_bot/ instead.
Conversely, the Discord slice should depend only on an ingestion interface (not on concrete ingestion modules).
Example fix
If you previously had:

# bad – this path no longer exists
from features.ingestion.discord import DiscordIngestionService
Change it to point at your actual ingestion implementation:

# good – matches your folder structure
from features.ingestion.service import IngestionService
3. Enforce clear vertical-slice boundaries

Adopt this pattern so each feature folder owns its code and public interface:

features/
├─ discord_bot/
│   ├─ __init__.py
│   ├─ bot.py                # TradingDiscordBot + on_message → hand off RawMessageDto
│   ├─ dto.py                # RawMessageDto.from_discord()
│   └─ interfaces.py         # IIngestionService abstraction
└─ ingestion/
    ├─ __init__.py
    ├─ service.py            # IngestionService implements IIngestionService
    └─ interfaces.py         # IIngestionService contract
Discord slice imports only from features.discord_bot.* and features.ingestion.interfaces.
Ingestion slice imports only from features.ingestion.* and the shared DTO (features.discord_bot.dto).
No direct cross-imports like features.ingestion.discord.
4. Double-check your Python packages

Make sure both features/discord_bot/ and features/ingestion/ have an __init__.py file so Python will recognize them as modules. Missing __init__.py can also trigger “No module named …” errors.

5. Add a quick integration test for import validation

Create a tiny test (e.g. tests/test_imports.py) that simply does:

def test_slices_import_cleanly():
    import features.discord_bot.bot
    import features.ingestion.service
This will immediately catch any broken paths without spinning up the entire app.

TL;DR
Remove any features.ingestion.discord imports (they point to a folder that doesn’t exist).
Correct them to features.ingestion.service (or whatever matches your actual file names).
Reinforce vertical-slice isolation by using clear interfaces (features/discord_bot/interfaces.py ↔ features/ingestion/interfaces.py).
Ensure every folder has __init__.py.
Add a lightweight import test to catch typos early.
