 FINAL FIX TASKS FOR 100% COMPLIANCE

🔧 1. Remove asyncio.new_event_loop() from features/discord_bot/api.py
File: features/discord_bot/api.py
Line: ~45
Issue: Manually creating a new event loop can fragment the system and lead to hard-to-debug concurrency issues.

Fix:
Replace:

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
loop.run_until_complete(some_async_function())
With:

import asyncio
asyncio.run(some_async_function())
Or, if inside a Flask/SocketIO context, use:

from flask_socketio import SocketIO
socketio.start_background_task(some_async_function)
Goal: Always re-use the main asyncio loop or background task mechanism from your server framework.

🔧 2. Remove asyncio.new_event_loop() from features/market/client.py
File: features/market/client.py
Line: ~78
Issue: Same fragmentation risk as above, especially if this module interacts with feed.py or Alpaca streams.

Fix:
If this is part of a CLI or data backfill command, wrap in:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
If it’s an imported module: pass the loop down from the caller.

🧼 3. Optional Cleanup: Delete Deprecated Files
File: common/events/enhanced_publisher.py
Action:

Delete the file if unused in the codebase.
If tests still import from it, migrate them to use publisher.py.
🧼 4. Remove Deprecated consumer.py::subscribe_to_events()
File: common/events/consumer.py
Action:

Delete or comment out all legacy subscribe_to_events() logic.
Add a docstring to the file:
“Deprecated: This module has been replaced by PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY in publisher.py.”
✅ 5. Add a Final events/README.md for Developer Clarity
Content:

# Event System Architecture (PostgreSQL-Only)

This app exclusively uses PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY for all cross-slice communication.
All events must be published and consumed using the functions in `common/events/publisher.py`.

❌ No in-memory queues
❌ No Redis/Socket-based event handlers
✅ Use `publish_event()` and `listen_for_events()` only

Refer to `publisher.py` for implementation details.
