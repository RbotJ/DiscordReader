1. Prefer constructor-injection over new‚Äôing services in __init__
Right now you do:

python
Copy
Edit
self.ingestion_service = IngestionService()
self.channel_manager  = ChannelManager()
Instead, have your bootstrap code pass those in:

python
Copy
Edit
def __init__(self, ingestion_service, channel_manager, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(**kwargs)
    self.ingestion_service = ingestion_service
    self.channel_manager   = channel_manager
    ‚Ä¶
This lets you swap in fakes in tests, and keeps your slice boundary clear (Discord slice only knows the interface, not how the service is built).

2. Unify channel-ID types
You compare as strings here:

python
Copy
Edit
if str(message.channel.id) == self.aplus_setups_channel_id:
but elsewhere you treat IDs as ints. Pick one (ideally int) and keep it consistent:

python
Copy
Edit
self.aplus_setups_channel_id: Optional[int] = None
‚Ä¶ 
if message.channel.id == self.aplus_setups_channel_id:
That avoids subtle bugs if someone passes in "12345" vs 12345.

3. Use @tasks.loop for periodic latency tracking
Rather than spawning your own background task, leverage discord.py‚Äôs built-in:

python
Copy
Edit
from discord.ext import tasks

class BotStatusTracker:
    @tasks.loop(seconds=5.0)
    async def track_latency(self):
        self.latency_ms = round(self._bot.latency * 1000)
Start it in on_ready() (self.track_latency.start()), and cancel it in on_disconnect().

4. Eliminate bare print() calls in favor of logging
You have:

python
Copy
Edit
print(f"ü§ñ Instantiating Bot from {‚Ä¶}")
Switch to:

python
Copy
Edit
logger.debug("Instantiating Bot from %s", __file__)
so you can control verbosity centrally and capture everything in your log files.

5. Fix DiscordClientManager.get_channel_id()
You return self.channel_id, but that property is never set. Instead, you probably want to proxy through the bot‚Äôs aplus_setups_channel_id:

python
Copy
Edit
def get_channel_id(self):
    return self.client.aplus_setups_channel_id if self.client else None
6. Tighten your event wiring
Right now your bot directly instantiates IngestionService and ChannelManager. If you move that into your start_discord_bot_background(app) composition, you‚Äôll:

Build ingestion_svc and channel_svc once

Do bot = TradingDiscordBot(ingestion_svc, channel_svc, intents=‚Ä¶)

Avoid any ‚Äúmissing dependencies‚Äù at runtime

7. Refactor the status tracker initialization
Instead of calling initialize_status_tracker(self) in on_ready, have your bootstrap do it immediately after you create the bot:

python
Copy
Edit
bot = TradingDiscordBot(‚Ä¶)
initialize_status_tracker(bot)
That way your tracker is always registered, even if on_ready is delayed.

TL;DR
Inject your services instead of new‚Äôing them in the bot

Consistently use int for channel IDs

Use @tasks.loop for latency polling

Drop print() in favor of structured logging

Correct the get_channel_id() accessor

Compose your slices once at startup, not scattered in methods

With those tweaks, your Discord slice will remain perfectly vertical‚Äîfully testable, decoupled, and production-ready.
