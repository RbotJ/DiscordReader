🧠 Issue 1: Multiple Message IDs per Trading Day
Expected: One message per trading day
Observed: Multiple messages linked to the same trading_day

Potential Causes:
A+ Parser Pass-Through: You're not enforcing a unique constraint at the DB or parser level. If the same trading_day is extracted multiple times (e.g. "Thursday May 29" in reused headers), it will associate each message with that date.

Fallback to Timestamp: If _extract_trading_day() fails and fallback logic kicks in using the message timestamp, you may end up with trading days that are:

Repeated for messages sent within the same calendar day (even hours apart).

Pulled from incorrect timezones (if your get_trading_day() isn’t TZ-aware).

🧠 Issue 2: Only 3 Unique Trading Days Found Despite 15+ Messages
Expected: One unique trading_day per message, assuming 1 per day
Observed: Setup records only exist for 3 unique dates

Potential Causes:
Missing Trading Day Match: _extract_trading_day() fails if the date string doesn’t match the exact “Thursday May 29” format. If messages lack this, they fall back to timestamp parsing.

Fallback Failure: If the fallback get_trading_day() isn't accurate or isn’t run (e.g. due to missing timestamp field or exception raised), trading_day ends up None.

Filtering in Store Layer: Even if the parser returns trading_day, the DB write logic may:

Skip storing parsed setups if trading_day is None

Overwrite or deduplicate setups unintentionally

✅ Parser Audit Enhancements
To debug and future-proof, I recommend:

1. Add Logging + Metrics in parse_message_to_setups()
Count how often _extract_trading_day() succeeds

Log fallback usage and result

Track how many parsed setups return trading_day = None

python
Copy
Edit
if not trading_day:
    logger.warning(f"No trading day found for message {message_id}")
2. New Audit: Message Count by Trading Day
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT trading_day, COUNT(DISTINCT message_id) FROM trade_setups GROUP BY trading_day ORDER BY trading_day DESC;
3. New Audit: Messages Without Associated Setups
Compare count of messages in discord_messages vs trade_setups joined on message_id.
