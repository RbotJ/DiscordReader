Database issues preventing pages from loading‚Äîespecially in a Streamlit + Plotly setup‚Äîtypically fall into a few common categories. Here's a diagnostic breakdown and how to make your system more robust:

üîç Likely Causes
1. Blocking Queries or Timeouts
Streamlit is synchronous by default. If your database query is slow or blocking, the UI will hang.

Plotly charts waiting for data won't render, making the entire section appear broken.

Fix:
Use @st.cache_data or asyncio patterns with connection pooling (e.g., asyncpg for PostgreSQL) to pre-fetch and store data.

2. Missing or Corrupt Data
If a setup or ticker is parsed but not saved properly, queries may return None or crash chart rendering.

Fix:
Add robust null-checks before trying to render charts. Also log missing records to debug faster.

python
Copy
Edit
if df is None or df.empty:
    st.warning("No data available for this ticker.")
    st.stop()
3. Schema Drift
Your chart expects certain fields (like timestamp, open, close), but a change in the DB model or data type can break serialization.

Fix:
Run validation on the DataFrame before plotting:

python
Copy
Edit
required_cols = ['timestamp', 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close']
missing = [c for c in required_cols if c not in df.columns]
if missing:
    st.error(f"Missing columns: {missing}")
4. Concurrent Access or Locked DB
On Replit or shared environments, too many simultaneous writes/reads may hit SQLite‚Äôs locking limits.

Fix:
Consider switching to a managed PostgreSQL (via Supabase, Neon, etc.), or adding retry logic using something like tenacity.

üõ†Ô∏è Robustness Improvements
Database Access Layer with Graceful Fallbacks

Create a wrapper function for DB reads that includes retry, timeout, and null handling.

Log All Exceptions

Add try/except blocks around all DB calls and chart renderers.

Preload and Cache

Preload today's setups and prices at app start, store in st.session_state or st.cache_data.

Monitor Page Fault-Tolerance

Render non-critical UI elements even if a specific chart fails.

‚úÖ Immediate Fix Checklist
Check	Description
‚úÖ DB Connection	Ensure the DB connection is alive and not stale
‚úÖ Query Profiling	Log query durations to spot bottlenecks
‚úÖ Data Integrity	Add sanity checks for each ticker's OHLC data
‚úÖ Caching Layer	Use Streamlit's @st.cache_data or Redis pub/sub where possible
‚úÖ Error Handling	Catch and surface all exceptions to UI logs
‚úÖ Fallback Charts	Display a placeholder chart or ‚Äúdata unavailable‚Äù message when necessary
