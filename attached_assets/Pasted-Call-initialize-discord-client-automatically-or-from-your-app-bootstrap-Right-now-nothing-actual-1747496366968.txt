Call initialize_discord_client() automatically (or from your app bootstrap)
Right now nothing actually spins up your bot until you explicitly call that function. Either

Call it at the bottom of the module (so an import fires it),

Or most cleanly, call it from your main application’s entry-point (e.g. after your Flask/FastAPI app starts).

That way you never forget to start the thread.

2. Fallback to fetch_channel() in send_message
If your guilds/channels come and go, get_channel() can return None. Instead of immediately failing, try:

python
Copy
Edit
chan = discord_client.get_channel(channel_id) \
       or await discord_client.fetch_channel(channel_id)
That makes your send/send_test helpers more resilient.

3. Expose “since” in get_channel_messages
Rather than brute-forcing the last 20 each time, let callers pass a since: datetime (defaulting to your last_checked_time). Then:

python
Copy
Edit
async for msg in chan.history(after=since, limit=100):
    …
That prevents duplicate reads, and lets you do “give me everything in the last X minutes” downstream.

4. Graceful shutdown hook
Daemon threads exit abruptly; if you ever deploy behind a reloader or want to clean up:

python
Copy
Edit
def shutdown_discord_client():
    if discord_client and client_ready:
        fut = asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(discord_client.close(),
                                               discord_client.loop)
        fut.result(5)
Wire that into your app’s shutdown event so sockets close cleanly.

5. Centralize your formatting
All of your send_status_update, send_trade_alert, etc., are thin wrappers over send_bot_message(format(...)). You could replace them with:

python
Copy
Edit
def _format_and_send(prefix: str, content: str):
    return send_bot_message(f"**{prefix}** {content}")

def send_status_update(msg):     return _format_and_send("Status Update:", msg)
def send_error_notification(e,d):return _format_and_send(f"Error [{e}]:", d)
…so it’s one less copy/paste.

6. Move your polling interval into a constant
Right now @tasks.loop(minutes=5) is hardcoded. You might export:

python
Copy
Edit
POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES = int(os.getenv("SETUP_POLL_INTERVAL", 5))
…
@tasks.loop(minutes=POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES)
That way you can tune it without a deploy.

7. Add type hints & mypy
Your signatures are pretty clear, but consider:

python
Copy
Edit
def send_message(channel_id: int, message: str) -> bool: …
def get_channel_messages() -> List[Dict[str, Union[str, datetime]]]:
…so your IDE catches mismatches.

8. Unit-test your helpers in isolation
Mock out a dummy discord_client with a loop and stubbed get_channel/fetch_channel,

Test that send_message schedules and resolves correctly,

Test get_channel_messages logic on fake messages (with and without embeds).

Since the core logic lives in those two functions, you’ll get a lot of confidence from a handful of pytest fixtures.
