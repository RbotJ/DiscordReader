Dashboard Implementations Overview
Here's a summary of each dashboard's specific focus:

flask_streamlit_dashboard.py - Comprehensive dashboard connecting to Flask API for account status, position monitoring, price charts, and order execution
discord_stats_dashboard.py - Focused on Discord message statistics and visualization
trade_monitor_dashboard.py - Real-time monitoring of active trades and positions
streamlit_dashboard.py - Full trading dashboard with direct Alpaca API integration
monitoring_dashboard.py - Focused on trade setups, market signals, and price monitoring
daily_ticker_dashboard.py - Tracks daily ticker performance and statistics
simple_dashboard.py - Basic PostgreSQL-based monitoring
Consolidation Plan
I recommend implementing a modular dashboard system within a new feature slice that allows different views while maintaining a consistent data access layer:

Step 1: Create the dashboard feature structure
features/
  /dashboard/
    /README.md           # Documentation
    /__init__.py         # Package initialization
    /api_routes.py       # API endpoints for dashboard data
    /components/         # UI components
    /services/           # Business logic
    /app.py              # Main Streamlit app
    /views/              # Different dashboard views
Step 2: Design the component architecture
The key to a successful consolidation is designing reusable components that can be composed into different views:

Data providers - Classes that fetch data from different sources (API, database)
UI components - Reusable chart, table, and form components
Layout templates - Page structures for different monitoring needs
View controllers - Logic for each specific dashboard view
Step 3: Implementation strategy
Here's how we can approach this:

Create the basic structure and implement the data access layer
Convert each existing dashboard into a view in the new system
Implement shared components used across multiple views
Create a navigation system to switch between views
Add user preferences for customizing the dashboard
