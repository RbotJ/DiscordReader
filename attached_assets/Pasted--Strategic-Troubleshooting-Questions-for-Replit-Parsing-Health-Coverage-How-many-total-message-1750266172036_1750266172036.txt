✅ Strategic Troubleshooting Questions for Replit
🔍 Parsing Health & Coverage
How many total messages are stored in discord_messages?

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM discord_messages;
How many of those are valid A+ messages (based on content)?

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM discord_messages WHERE content ILIKE '%A+%Setup%';
How many A+ messages have successfully created entries in trade_setups?

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT message_id) FROM trade_setups;
Compare timestamps and message lengths for parsed vs unparsed A+ messages.

Identify if the parser is mistakenly skipping better candidates.

⚠️ Parser Validation Logic
Which validate_message() condition is most often rejecting messages?

Add logging for:

Token match failure

Message too short

Contains test/placeholder text

Regex mismatch

Does every skipped A+ message produce a failure reason in the failure_tracker.py?

If not, instrument parse_message() and validate_message() to capture every rejection with message_id and reason.

Are any messages mistakenly identified as duplicates due to time zone conversion issues?

Log both UTC and America/Chicago conversions per message during duplicate detection.

📅 Duplicate Handling
Are any duplicate deletions being incorrectly triggered for messages with different trading_day values?

Verify:

python
Copy
Edit
trade_setup.trading_day == new_candidate_trading_day
before deletion.

Are any duplicates being silently skipped due to DUPLICATE_POLICY="skip" being hardcoded somewhere?

📈 Dashboard Data Validation
Is the parsed message count on the dashboard matching the database?

Compare:

Frontend display (parsing_stats.total_setups)

DB query (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trade_setups;)

Does the duplicate audit section reflect real duplicates from recent messages?

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT trading_day, COUNT(DISTINCT message_id)
FROM trade_setups
GROUP BY trading_day
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT message_id) > 1;
🧪 Test Case Completeness
Has the parser been tested with:

A message without a header?

A message with an invalid ticker block?

A message with valid trigger/target pairs but malformed bias?

A message with duplicate ticker sections?

Does the backlog re-processing always re-validate existing setups, or skip previously processed ones?

Confirm that the backlog runner doesn’t skip valid messages by mistake.
