the event is clearly leaving the bot, but not completing ingestion. Here's a structured audit path to help you pinpoint exactly where it failed and why, without making assumptions or unnecessary changes.

🧠 Live Message Audit Flow: Discord → Ingestion
Let’s inspect each link in the chain, with specific commands/logs to check.

✅ 1. Did the Bot Trigger Ingestion?
Check console logs for:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[on_message] Triggering ingestion for message ID: ...
[discord_bot] Published ingestion event: ...
[discord_bot] Full payload: { ... }
If present → event left the bot ✅

✅ 2. Did the Listener Receive the Event?
Expected log:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[listener] Received event: discord.message.new with payload ID: ...
🔍 If this is not present, it likely means the listener didn’t receive the NOTIFY message. Double-check:

Is ingestion process running?

Is listener using listen_for_events(...)?

Is channel="events" hardcoded or implied?

✅ 3. Did the Service Process the Payload?
Look for:

csharp
Copy
Edit
[ingestion] Processing Discord message: ...
[ingestion] Validated message: ...
[ingestion] Stored message ID: ...
Or:

css
Copy
Edit
[ingestion] Failed to process message: ...
🔍 If these are missing, it means:

handle_event() may be ignoring the event type

process_discord_message_event() not called or crashing silently

✅ 4. Are Metrics Updating?
Check:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl http://localhost:5000/dashboard/ingestion/enhanced-metrics.json | python -m json.tool
messages_ingested_today should increment

last_ingestion timestamp should update

duplicates_skipped may help if message was already seen

✅ 5. Is the Message Stored in the DB?
Query the discord_messages or ingested_messages table (example):

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM discord_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
Check for:

Matching message_id

Correct channel_id, author_id, etc.

Row timestamp near current time

🚨 If Something Failed: Key Logs to Search
Run filtered log queries:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep "discord.message.new" /tmp/gunicorn.log
grep "Stored message ID" /tmp/gunicorn.log
grep "Failed to process" /tmp/gunicorn.log
These can help detect:

Parsing/validation errors

DB insert failures

Silent skips or exceptions
