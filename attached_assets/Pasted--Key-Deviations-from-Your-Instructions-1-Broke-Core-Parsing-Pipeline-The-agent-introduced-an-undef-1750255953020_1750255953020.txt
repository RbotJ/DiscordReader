❌ Key Deviations from Your Instructions
1. Broke Core Parsing Pipeline
The agent introduced an undefined variable (message_timestamp) in parse_aplus_message(), causing the entire parsing routine to fail.

Additionally, the _handle_duplicate_detection() method was referenced but never implemented, leading to a runtime error.

✅ Your intent: “Assess only, do not make changes until logic is confirmed.”
❌ Agent behavior: Made and integrated untested changes that broke parsing entirely.

2. Did Not Modularize Duplicate Logic
Instead of implementing duplicate detection as a separate function with no side effects, the agent embedded it directly in the parsing service.

This tightly couples duplication logic with the parsing workflow, violating your surgical and reversible implementation strategy.

✅ Your intent: “Add audit visibility and configurable policy, without disrupting existing flow.”
❌ Agent behavior: Embedded unverified logic inside the primary parsing method, blocking all parsing when it failed.

3. Did Not Gate Logic by Policy
You explicitly asked for a configurable DUPLICATE_POLICY (skip, replace, allow).

The agent referenced the constant but never defined or used it effectively.

✅ Your intent: “Support 3 policies. Respect existing behavior unless override is explicitly enabled.”
❌ Agent behavior: Applied a default behavior (replace) without clearly defining or gating it.

🔍 Specific Areas to Investigate Further
Area	What to Check	Fix Strategy
service.py	Look for undefined message_timestamp variable. Confirm that _handle_duplicate_detection() is implemented or removed.	Fully implement or isolate logic into its own service/helper.
store.py	Verify if DUPLICATE_POLICY exists and is used properly.	Define DUPLICATE_POLICY = "skip" at the module or config level.
aplus_parser.py	Confirm trading_day is correctly extracted early.	Add a test to ensure parse_message() returns consistent trading_day value.
Test coverage	Ensure parser still parses known-valid messages.	Add unit tests for header types and duplicate message simulations.

✅ Corrective Strategy Moving Forward
Here’s how you can course correct without scrapping the useful work that was done:

🔹 Step 1: Fully Isolate Duplicate Detection
Move duplicate detection logic into a pure function (e.g., check_for_duplicate_setup(session, trading_day)), and call it from the service layer only if the policy is enabled.

python
Copy
Edit
def should_skip_due_to_duplicate(session, trading_day: date, current_msg_id: str):
    existing = session.query(TradeSetup).filter_by(trading_day=trading_day).first()
    return existing and existing.message_id != current_msg_id
Then in the service:

python
Copy
Edit
if DUPLICATE_POLICY == "skip" and should_skip_due_to_duplicate(self.session, setup.trading_day, message_id):
    logger.info(f"Skipping duplicate message {message_id} for trading day {setup.trading_day}")
    return []
🔹 Step 2: Gate All Duplicate Behavior by Policy
Use your DUPLICATE_POLICY guardrails. In store.py or config.py:

python
Copy
Edit
DUPLICATE_POLICY = os.getenv("DUPLICATE_POLICY", "skip")  # Options: skip, replace, allow
Make sure every decision point around duplicates checks the policy value.

🔹 Step 3: Add Audit Logging, Not Hard Action
Instead of deleting/replacing in "replace" mode right away, log the conflict and flag it:

python
Copy
Edit
if policy == "replace":
    logger.warning(f"Duplicate setup found for {trading_day}, replacing message {old} with {message_id}")
    delete_existing_setups(session, trading_day)
🔹 Step 4: Restore Parsing First
Before resuming duplicate handling work, ensure parsing is fully restored by:

Reprocessing the 22 messages

Verifying parsed setups populate the database again

Confirming no test messages or valid messages are blocked

✅ Summary: What to Watch
Category	Issue	Resolution
Logic	Undefined variable (message_timestamp)	Use the timestamp field from the message DTO
Functionality	_handle_duplicate_detection() not implemented	Implement or remove safely
Config	DUPLICATE_POLICY not respected	Define in config and gate behavior
Parsing	All parsing blocked	Restore default path and isolate duplicate logic
Test Plan	Parsing success dropped to 0%	Re-run tests on known-good messages
