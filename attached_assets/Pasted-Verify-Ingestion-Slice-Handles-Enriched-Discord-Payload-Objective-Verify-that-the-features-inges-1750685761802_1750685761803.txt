Verify Ingestion Slice Handles Enriched Discord Payload
🎯 Objective:
Verify that the features/ingestion/ slice correctly receives and processes the full Discord message payload published by the discord_bot slice. Ensure all fields are validated, stored, and logged appropriately.

🔍 Checklist for features/ingestion/
1. Event Listener Behavior
📍 File: listener.py

Confirms it listens for "discord.message.new" via listen_for_events(...)

Logs incoming event (e.g., "Received event: discord.message.new with payload ID...")

Passes full payload to process_discord_message_event(...) or equivalent

2. Payload Field Handling
📍 File: service.py (or validator.py)

Confirms fields from the payload are accessed:

message_id, channel_id, author_id, author_name, content, timestamp

Logs any missing or invalid fields

Ensures content validation (length, formatting, not empty)

3. Storage Layer
📍 File: store.py or models.py

Confirms data model or DB insert includes:

message_id, author_id, author_name, content, timestamp, etc.

If not already present, suggest whether these fields should be added

4. Logging
Confirms log output like:

"Stored message ID: ...", "Rejected message ID: ... due to validation error"

Logs payload or field issues (e.g., truncated content, malformed timestamps)

5. Metrics / Observability
Confirms:

messages_ingested_today metric is updated

last_ingestion timestamp is updated

duplicates_skipped is tracked
