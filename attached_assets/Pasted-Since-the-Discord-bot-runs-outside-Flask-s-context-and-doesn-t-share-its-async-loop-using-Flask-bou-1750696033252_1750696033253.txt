Since the Discord bot runs outside Flask’s context and doesn’t share its async loop, using Flask-bound publishing (publish_event_safe) fails silently. Here's a recommended prompt to finalize Step 2 – Event Publishing, ensure direct DB writes from the bot, and enable proper logging:

Please fix Step 2: Event Publishing from the Discord bot.

Problem:
- The Discord bot runs in an async context and fails to publish ingestion events because `publish_event_safe()` checks for Flask app context.
- No events appear in the `events` table.
- No logs show "[discord_bot] Published ingestion event: ..."

Instructions:
1. In `common/events/publisher.py`, add a new function:
```python
def publish_event_direct(event_type: str, channel: str, payload: dict, source: str = "unknown"):
    from common.db import SessionLocal
    from common.models import Event
    from datetime import datetime
    import uuid
    session = SessionLocal()
    try:
        event = Event(
            id=str(uuid.uuid4()),
            event_type=event_type,
            channel=channel,
            payload=payload,
            source=source,
            correlation_id=payload.get("message_id", str(uuid.uuid4())),
            created_at=datetime.utcnow(),
        )
        session.add(event)
        session.commit()
        return event.id
    except Exception as e:
        session.rollback()
        raise
    finally:
        session.close()
In features/discord_bot/bot.py, replace the call to publish_event_safe or publish_event_async with:

python
Copy
Edit
from common.events.publisher import publish_event_direct

event_id = publish_event_direct("discord.message.new", "events", payload, source="discord_bot")
logger.info("[discord_bot] Published ingestion event directly: %s", event_id)
Restart the application.

Post a test message in #aplus-setups.

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT event_type, correlation_id, created_at FROM events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
Also check logs for:

bash
Copy
Edit
grep -E "\[discord_bot\] Published ingestion event directly" /proc/$(pgrep -f gunicorn)/fd/1
Confirm:
✅ Event appears in DB
✅ Log confirms publishing
✅ Correlation ID matches test message ID

If this works, you can optionally wrap publish_event_direct() with retry logic or switch back to async in the future when your architecture evolves.

Let me know when you’re ready to continue to Step 3 – Listener Receipt & Processing.
