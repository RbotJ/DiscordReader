Validate Live Discord Bot Connectivity
🎯 Objective:
Verify that the Discord bot is not only initialized and stored in app.config, but also actively connected to the Discord API and functioning properly.

🔍 Validation Checklist
Please verify the following — do not make changes yet unless instructed.

✅ 1. Discord Gateway Connection

Confirm that the bot has connected to the Discord WebSocket Gateway.
There should be log entries such as:
[INFO] Bot ready - logged in as MyBot#1234
or:

[INFO] Discord bot has connected to the gateway
✅ 2. API Status Response Accuracy

Hit /api/discord/status and confirm:
{"status": "connected"}
or "ready" — anything besides "not_initialized".
Check the logic in the status endpoint:
Does it return status based on bot.is_ready() or bot.client.is_ready()?
Does it account for async delay during initial connection?
✅ 3. Async Task Completion

Confirm that any await bot.start() or await bot.connect() calls inside app.py or background startup complete successfully.
Check for:
Runtime warnings like "coroutine was never awaited"
Errors like "no running event loop" during startup
✅ 4. Event Handling Readiness

Confirm that the bot has received and logged at least one event (e.g., on_ready, on_message).
Validate that the message counter in the dashboard increases when a message is posted in the configured channel.
✅ 5. Blueprint & Frontend Route Integrity

Confirm that:
/dashboard/discord/ route loads without errors
register_all_blueprints() in app.py includes the Discord blueprint (discord_bp)
JavaScript assets for the bot dashboard are loading (check console logs for missing files)
