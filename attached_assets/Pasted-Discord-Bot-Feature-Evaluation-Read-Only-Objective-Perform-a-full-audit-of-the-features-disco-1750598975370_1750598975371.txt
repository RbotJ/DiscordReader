Discord Bot Feature Evaluation (Read-Only)

🎯 Objective:
Perform a full audit of the features/discord_bot/ feature slice. This is the first component in the event flow pipeline and must comply with the current event-driven architecture using PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY.

🔍 Evaluation Criteria
Please inspect only—do not make any changes yet. Report your findings under these categories:

✅ 1. Architectural Compliance

Does the feature adhere to vertical-slice architecture principles?
Are all external interactions (e.g., event publishing) routed through common.events.publisher?
Are there any legacy patterns (e.g., in-memory bus, threading hacks, manual loops)?
🔐 2. Event Flow Integrity

When a Discord message is received:
Is it triggering the correct publish_event_async(...) call?
Are the published events logged?
Are event payloads structured correctly (e.g., includes message_id, channel_id)?
Are events being published from within the main async loop?
🧼 3. Code Cleanliness and Maintainability

Are there any unused functions, imports, or TODOs that should be cleaned up?
Are there any duplicate logging, overly verbose debug output, or unreachable code paths?
Are docstrings and comments up to date with the PostgreSQL event model?
🧪 4. Testing & Observability

Is the Discord bot’s behavior verifiable through logging?
Are there tests or testable entry points for Discord message ingestion or mocking?
Are there retry or fail-safe mechanisms in place (e.g., retry if Discord API temporarily fails)?
🔒 5. Security & Resilience

Are Discord bot tokens and secrets accessed securely from environment variables?
Is there protection against untrusted message sources or formats?
📂 Target Scope
