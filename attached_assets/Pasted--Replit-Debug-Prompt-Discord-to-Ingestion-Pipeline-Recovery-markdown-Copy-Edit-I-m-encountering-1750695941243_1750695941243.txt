I'm encountering issues with the Discord-to-Ingestion pipeline. Please follow these steps to diagnose and fix the system. Do not skip ahead â€” verify each step in order.

---

**STEP 1: Verify Discord Bot Detection**
- Confirm the bot is connected and monitoring the correct channel
- Post a new test message in `#aplus-setups`
- Check for logs like:
  - `[on_message] Triggering ingestion for message ID: ...`

---

**STEP 2: Verify Event Publishing**
- Check that `publish_event_async()` is called from the bot with:
  - event = `"discord.message.new"`
  - channel = `"events"`
- Ensure the payload includes:
  - message_id, channel_id, author_id, author_name, content, timestamp
- Fix any `asyncio loop` attachment errors
- Confirm logs:
  - `[discord_bot] Published ingestion event: ...`
  - `[discord_bot] Full payload: { ... }`

---

**STEP 3: Verify PostgreSQL Listener**
- Confirm the ingestion listener starts with the app (during first request or boot)
- Check logs:
  - `PostgreSQL ingestion listener started`
  - `Received event: discord.message.new ...`
- Verify active LISTEN with:
```sql
SELECT pid, application_name, state, query FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE query LIKE '%LISTEN%' OR application_name LIKE '%python%';
STEP 4: Verify Ingestion Event Processing

Confirm that handle_event() in the ingestion service routes the event

Check logs:

[ingestion] Processing Discord message: ...

[ingestion] Stored message ID: ...

STEP 5: Confirm Message Storage

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT message_id, content, created_at FROM discord_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
Confirm the new test message appears

Confirm /dashboard/ingestion/enhanced-metrics.json shows:

messages_ingested_today > 0

last_ingestion is recent

If any step fails, debug it in place and report exactly what failed with logs or traceback. Ensure the entire Discord â†’ Event â†’ Listener â†’ Service â†’ Database flow is confirmed working.

Letâ€™s resolve this pipeline once and for all. âœ…
