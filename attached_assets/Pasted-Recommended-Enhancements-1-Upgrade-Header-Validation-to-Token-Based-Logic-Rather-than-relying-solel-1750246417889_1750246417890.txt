Recommended Enhancements
1. Upgrade Header Validation to Token-Based Logic
Rather than relying solely on regex like:

python
Copy
Edit
self.header_pattern = re.compile(r'A\+\s*(?:SCALP|Scalp)\s*(?:TRADE\s*)?(?:SETUPS|Setups)', re.IGNORECASE)
Use a simple normalized token check like:

python
Copy
Edit
def has_aplus_header(content: str) -> bool:
    header_tokens = content.splitlines()[0].lower().replace('‚Äî', '-').split()
    return 'a+' in header_tokens and 'scalp' in header_tokens and 'setup' in ' '.join(header_tokens)
Then use this check before or in combination with regex.

2. Improve Message Guard Logic
Enhance the validate_message() method to:

Reject messages with known test indicators: test, draft, ignore

Reject messages shorter than a reasonable threshold (e.g., under 300 characters)

Confirm presence of at least one ticker section

python
Copy
Edit
if any(w in content.lower() for w in ["test", "draft", "ignore this", "dev only"]):
    logger.debug("Message skipped due to test indicators")
    return False

if len(content.strip()) < 300:
    logger.debug("Message skipped: content too short")
    return False
3. Unify Date Parsing With Fallback and Logging
You already use extract_trading_day() with fallback logic. Improve logging here:

When fallback is used, print UTC ‚Üí CST conversion

When a date is parsed from the header, validate against weekday (Mon‚ÄìFri)

python
Copy
Edit
if extracted_date.weekday() >= 5:
    logger.warning(f"Extracted trading date falls on a weekend: {extracted_date}")
4. Bias Handling Edge Case Fix
You currently skip bias lines by checking for prefix ‚ö†Ô∏è in the ticker section. This works but can fail if:

Bias is not isolated properly from the ticker setup lines

Newline formatting varies (extra \n between bias and tickers)

Fix: Ensure the bias is always extracted before ticker sections are parsed, and strip it from the content passed to parse_ticker_section.

5. Log Setup Count vs. Expected
Right now audit_profile_coverage() is helpful but could log:

Expected count vs actual count

Missing common profile labels by frequency across messages

This helps detect if setups are being skipped due to:

Misclassified lines

Price structure failures

6. Improve Price Structure Tolerance
For partial line failures like:

yaml
Copy
Edit
Above 599.00 üîº Target 1: 601.00
Try a relaxed parse as a fallback:

Extract all numbers

Use first as trigger, rest as targets

Log as "fallback-pricing-mode"

7. Metrics for Partial vs Full Message Success
Add to parse result:

python
Copy
Edit
'parse_quality': {
    'total_lines': 28,
    'lines_parsed': 22,
    'ticker_sections': 3,
    'bias_extracted': True
}
This lets your dashboard show a parse health score or flag degraded messages.

üß† Strategic Recommendations
‚úÖ Consolidate Parsing Failures
Create a log table or event bus entry when a message fails to parse. Store:

Message ID

Reason (header missing, price parse failed, etc.)

Timestamp

Parsed ticker count
This lets you reprocess or review failure reasons without rerunning the whole backlog.

‚úÖ Add Unit Tests for Common Format Variations
Create 20+ test messages with variations of:

Headers

Emoji styles

Line structure

Edge cases (typos, dashes, spacing)
Validate:

Header recognition

Ticker parsing

Setup extraction
