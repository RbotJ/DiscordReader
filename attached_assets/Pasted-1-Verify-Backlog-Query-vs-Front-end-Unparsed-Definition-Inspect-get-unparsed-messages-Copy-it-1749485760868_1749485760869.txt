1. Verify Backlog Query vs. Front-end “Unparsed” Definition
Inspect get_unparsed_messages()

Copy its SQL and run it directly in psql (or your database client) against your 39 messages.

Does it actually return all 39 rows?

If not, your “unparsed” filter (e.g. WHERE message_id NOT IN (SELECT message_id FROM trade_setups)) may be wrong (perhaps it’s pointing at the old trade_setups table instead of your “new” table).

Cross–check table names

Make sure your backlog code is looking at the same table the ingestion UI shows (discord_messages) and writing to the same table your dropdown reads (trade_setups or new_trade_setups). A mismatch here could make you process into one table while the UI reads from another.

2. Add Detailed Logging Around Each Message
Wrap your parsing loop so you log, for each message:

python
Copy
Edit
for raw in unparsed_messages:
    try:
        setup_dto, levels = parse_message_to_setup(raw)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[ParseBacklog] message {raw.id} failed to parse: {e}")
        continue

    try:
        insert_trade_setup_and_levels(raw.id, setup_dto, levels, raw.timestamp)
        logger.info(f"[ParseBacklog] message {raw.id} → setup created")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"[ParseBacklog] message {raw.id} failed to store: {e}")
Then tail your logs when you click “Parse Backlog.” You’ll see exactly which messages:

never enter the parse_message_to_setup success block (i.e. parser exceptions)

parse but fail on the DB insert

If you see zero “→ setup created” lines, you know the parser regex is simply rejecting every message.

3. Unit-Test a Known Good Message
Take one of your sample messages directly from the DB:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT message_id, content
  FROM discord_messages
 LIMIT 1;
Then in a REPL or small script:

python
Copy
Edit
from features.parsing.parser import parse_message_to_setup

raw = {"id": "...", "content": "<that content>", "timestamp": "..."}
try:
    setup, levels = parse_message_to_setup(raw)
    print("Parsed:", setup, levels)
except Exception as e:
    print("Parse error:", e)
If this throws “Cannot parse header” or “Entry/Target/Stop not found,” tweak your regex to match the exact formatting (watch for extra whitespace, punctuation, multiple tickers per message, etc.).

4. Confirm Trading-Day Logic
Your “No Trading days available” dropdown only appears when at least one trade_setups.created_at::date maps to a valid trading day. If your parser:

is inserting with the wrong timestamp (e.g. using UTC vs. local), or

using a placeholder date outside market days,

then your day-picker will stay empty.

Check:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DISTINCT DATE(created_at) AS day
  FROM trade_setups;
— if that returns nothing, you still have zero inserts. If it returns dates, ensure your front end’s get_available_trading_days() matches those dates (timezones, date formats).

5. Improve “Success” Feedback
Right now your backlog action probably shows “success” because it:

python
Copy
Edit
return jsonify({"processed_count": len(unparsed_messages)})
Instead, include:

python
Copy
Edit
return jsonify({
  "processed": len(unparsed_messages),
  "created": successful_inserts,
  "failed": failures
})
That way you’ll immediately know if your parser is firing but simply never yielding any valid setups.

6. Recap & Next Steps
Validate your unparsed-messages SQL returns the IDs you expect.

Log parsing vs. storing success per message.

Unit-test your parser against a known sample.

Check that inserts carry correct created_at dates.

Enhance your API response to show real parsing/create counts.
