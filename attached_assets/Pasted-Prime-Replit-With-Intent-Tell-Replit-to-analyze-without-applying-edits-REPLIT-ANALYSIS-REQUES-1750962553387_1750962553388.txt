Prime Replit With Intent
Tell Replit to analyze without applying edits:

# 📍 REPLIT ANALYSIS REQUEST (No changes yet)
"""
You are an AI agent assessing a vertically sliced, event-driven trading application.

Your task is to review the current architecture and implementation for the following:

1. Adherence to vertical-slice isolation principles
2. Redundancy or cross-feature dependencies that could be refactored
3. Potential for plugin-style extensibility (like Red-DiscordBot cogs)
4. Opportunities for administrative dashboards or command-handling improvements
5. Suggestions for message export tooling (like DiscordChatExporter)
6. Use of PostgreSQL event bus — validate that events are well-isolated and well-documented

⚠️ Do NOT make any edits yet. Only return structured observations and actionable suggestions for improvement.
"""
✅ Step 2: Inject Replit Context
After the prompt, run the following in Replit:

from pathlib import Path

# Limit analysis to features/ and common/
paths_to_read = [
    *Path("features").rglob("*.py"),
    *Path("common").rglob("*.py"),
    Path("README.md"),
]

for path in paths_to_read:
    print(f"=== {path} ===\n")
    print(path.read_text())
This gives Replit the core architectural context while being token-efficient (as recommended by IDD).

✅ Step 3: Get Specific Feedback from Replit
Here’s a structured checklist to include in your prompt to elicit high-value, slice-aware responses:

# 📋 FEEDBACK REQUEST CHECKLIST

Please evaluate the following:

1. 🔍 Vertical Slice Isolation
   - Are slices truly self-contained (API, model, service)?
   - Are any utils bleeding across slices?

2. 🧩 Plugin-Like Extensibility
   - Could each slice expose a `register()` or `setup()` function for dynamic loading?
   - What’s the minimal interface for a plugin?

3. 📊 Dashboard Extensibility
   - Could the dashboard support plugin modules or config-based slice toggling?
   - Are metrics observable per event (via correlation IDs)?

4. 🧾 Message Exporting Tools
   - How would you implement message history export (e.g., JSON download)?
   - What slice would it belong to—ingestion, a new export slice, or admin?

5. 🧠 AI Navigability
   - Are any slices too large for agents to reason about in isolation?
   - Can any be split or trimmed for better promptability?

6. 🛠️ Event Bus Sanity
   - Do all events originate from publisher.py?
   - Are any custom pub/sub flows bypassing PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY?

Return your assessment in a format like:

[✓] Finding: Vertical Slice Violation in parsing/

File: features/parsing/parser.py
Issue: Imports from features/ingestion/service.py detected.
Recommendation: Move shared logic to common/, or duplicate logic intentionally per vertical-slice principles.
