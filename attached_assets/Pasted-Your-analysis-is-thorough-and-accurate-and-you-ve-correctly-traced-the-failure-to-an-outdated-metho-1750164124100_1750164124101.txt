Your analysis is thorough and accurate, and you’ve correctly traced the failure to an outdated method call in the listener. Here's a concise assessment and recommended next steps to move forward safely and effectively — without making changes yet:

✅ Summary of Current State
Area	Status	Notes
Parser Engine	✅ MessageParser is implemented with parse_message() (correct method)	
Backlog Interface	✅ Clicking "Parse Backlog" triggers the expected flow	
Message Retrieval	✅ Backlog retrieves all raw unparsed Discord messages	
Parser Invocation	❌ listener.py calls self.parser.parse_message_to_setups() — this method no longer exists	
Message Parsing	❌ 19 of 21 messages fail due to AttributeError, not message content	
Successful Dates	✅ The two successful messages came through another functioning path, hence why only Jun 2 and Jun 9 appear	
Hybrid Date Extraction	✅ Appears functional, but not visible yet due to message processing failures	

🚧 Current Blocker
self.parser.parse_message_to_setups() is being called in features/parsing/listener.py
But MessageParser now only defines parse_message()

This mismatch leads to a hard failure (likely AttributeError) during backlog processing — completely bypassing the parsing logic for the majority of messages.

🔍 Next Diagnostic Checks (Before Making Fixes)
Confirm the Log Details
Look at logs from listener.py while clicking Parse Backlog.
You should see AttributeError: 'MessageParser' object has no attribute 'parse_message_to_setups' — if this shows up for each skipped message, the root cause is confirmed.

Confirm Integration Path
Make sure the operator button routes into listener.handle_parse_backlog() or equivalent — and that this function is the one calling self.parser.parse_message_to_setups().

Verify Recovery Behavior
Check if there's any fallback behavior in case of failure (e.g., try-catch that swallows errors).
If so, that could be why you’re not seeing stack traces but are seeing "silent" skips.

Check Parser Instantiation
Confirm that the injected parser instance in the listener is indeed the MessageParser (new class), not a legacy fallback.

✅ Next Steps Summary (After Verification)
Step	Task
1️⃣	Update listener.py to call self.parser.parse_message() instead of parse_message_to_setups()
2️⃣	Ensure the call includes message_id, content, and timestamp if required
3️⃣	Re-run backlog parser — confirm that previously skipped messages are now parsed and stored
4️⃣	Audit logs for: "Parsing message {message_id} with A+ parser" — this confirms new logic is used
5️⃣	Check that additional dates (e.g., June 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15) now appear in dashboard
