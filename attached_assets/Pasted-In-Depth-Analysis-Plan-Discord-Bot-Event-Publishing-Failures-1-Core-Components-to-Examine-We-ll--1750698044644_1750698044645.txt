In-Depth Analysis Plan: Discord Bot Event Publishing Failures
✅ 1. Core Components to Examine
We'll audit these components for correctness and reliability:

discord_bot.bot.on_message() → detects and initiates event flow

publish_event_safe() or publish_event() → async-safe publisher

common.events.publisher → responsible for formatting and routing event

PostgreSQL NOTIFY mechanism → actual event bus

Listener (start_ingestion_listener()) → consumes events from LISTEN events

⚠️ 2. Textbook Failure Modes (and Where to Check for Them)
Failure Mode	Symptoms	Audit Location	Typical Fix
❌ Wrong event loop	“attached to a different loop” error	publish_event_safe() or loop.run_until_complete(...)	Use asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe or isolate loop
❌ Missing async context	Event not awaited, no logs from publish_event	on_message() logic	Wrap await inside async def, or use thread-safe bridge
❌ Event structure malformed	Event published, but ingestion crashes or ignores	publisher.py, validate payload	Add validation schema before publishing
❌ No DB transaction / connection	“No connection” or “not in transaction” errors	publish_event() or DB wrapper	Ensure DB session management wraps NOTIFY
❌ No PostgreSQL listener running	No LISTEN in pg_stat_activity	ingestion startup logs	Fix start_ingestion_listener() or startup flow
❌ Publishing before listener starts	Message “published” but never seen	Startup timing mismatch	Delay bot startup until listener confirms active
❌ Silently failing try/except	No logs, no errors, nothing happens	publish_event_safe() or bot logic	Add structured logging + logger.exception() blocks
❌ Self-messages filtered too aggressively	Bot ignores everything, no logs	on_message() or message author ID check	Add debug log for skipped messages
❌ Wrong channel or event_type	Events go to wrong listener or are ignored	channel="events" vs "discord", etc.	Standardize event_type/channel naming

🧪 3. Checklist for Code Instrumentation
To detect these reliably, implement the following:

✅ Add debug logs:

Before/after every publish

Inside exception blocks (logger.exception)

When message is skipped due to filters

✅ Log the event_type, channel, and full payload being published

✅ In pg_stat_activity, confirm presence of LISTEN events

✅ In ingestion logs, confirm:

Received event

Processing message ID: xyz

✅ In database:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT message_id, created_at FROM discord_messages ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
🛠️ 4. Recommended Fix Plan (Once Failures Are Found)
Wrap all event publishing logic in:

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    await publish_event(...)
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("Failed to publish event")
If async context fails, fall back to:

python
Copy
Edit
asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(..., loop)
Ensure start_ingestion_listener() is:

Not dependent on app traffic

Confirmed by startup log like [init] Listener running

Seen in pg_stat_activity as active

Create a test harness that:

Posts a fake message via the bot

Publishes directly to event table

Asserts message ID appears in discord_messages
