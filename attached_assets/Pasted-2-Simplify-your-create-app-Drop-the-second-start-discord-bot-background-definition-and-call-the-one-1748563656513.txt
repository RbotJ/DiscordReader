2. Simplify your create_app
Drop the second start_discord_bot_background definition and call the one above, passing it your newly‚Äêcreated app:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import Flask
from common.db import initialize_db
from common.events.cleanup_service import cleanup_service

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # ‚Ä¶ all your config, initialize_db, register routes, socketio, etc. ‚Ä¶
    initialize_db(app)
    cleanup_service.start_cleanup_scheduler()
    register_feature_routes(app)
    register_web_routes(app)
    register_socketio_events()
    return app

# build & wire everything
app = create_app()

# start the bot using the same function, now with proper dependencies
start_discord_bot_background(app)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    socketio.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)
3. How the slices now stay isolated
Discord slice only depends on:

IIngestionService (the interface in features/discord_bot/interfaces.py)

DiscordChannelService (interface or concrete, whichever you choose)

Ingestion slice only depends on its own IIngestionService interface and DTOs

Discord-Channels slice only speaks to its own models & DB

Composition happens once in the start_discord_bot_background closure, and nowhere else

Next steps
Remove the extra start_discord_bot_background at the bottom of your file.

Ensure all imports in your slices use only the interfaces/DTOs, not concrete modules in other slices.

Run and look for your heartbeat in the logs:

csharp
Copy
Edit
‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Starting DiscordReader from /path/to/app.py
üîÑ Starting Discord bot...
‚úÖ Connected as YourBot#1234
Adjust your TradingDiscordBot (or DiscordClientManager) signature to accept the two services (ingestion_service, channel_service) if you haven‚Äôt already.

With this wiring in place, your bot will:

Discover channels via DiscordChannelService

Hand off each new message as a RawMessageDto to IngestionService

Leave parsing, storage, and event publishing entirely within the ingestion slice

Let me know if you need tweaks to the signatures or logging, or if you run into any new errors!
