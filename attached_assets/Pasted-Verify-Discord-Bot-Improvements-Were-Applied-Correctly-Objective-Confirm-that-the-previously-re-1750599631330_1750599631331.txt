Verify Discord Bot Improvements Were Applied Correctly

🎯 Objective:
Confirm that the previously reported improvements to features/discord_bot/bot.py were actually applied as described. This is a verification-only step—do not modify anything.

🧬 Scope
Restrict evaluation to features/discord_bot/bot.py only.

🔎 Verification Checklist
Please check the following items and confirm whether they are present, correct, and functioning as expected:

✅ 1. print() Statement Removal

Verify that no print(...) statements remain in the file.
Specifically confirm removal at or around line 151, where debug logging was previously done.
✅ 2. Logging Optimization

Check that excessive logger.debug(...) calls in the following areas have been reduced or removed:
on_message() method (lines ~140–170)
_trigger_ingestion() method
Message counting / channel mismatch / type filtering sections
✅ 3. Import Cleanup

Confirm the line:
from discord.ext import tasks
has been removed entirely, and that this import was not reintroduced elsewhere in bot.py.
✅ 4. Client Manager Comments

Around lines 40–60, check for any commented-out client manager initialization code.
Confirm that:
No large blocks of commented code remain
The remaining client manager logic is active and necessary
✅ 5. Async and Event Integrity

Confirm that publish_event_async(...) is still being called in _trigger_ingestion() (line ~192)
Confirm that no changes broke the event flow or async structure
