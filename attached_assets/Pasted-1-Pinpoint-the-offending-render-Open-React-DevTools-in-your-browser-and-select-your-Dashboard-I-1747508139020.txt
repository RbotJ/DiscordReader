1. Pinpoint the offending render
Open React DevTools in your browser and select your <Dashboard>.

In the Components pane, expand until you see the list that’s rendering your tickers, charts, or events.

Click on one of the duplicates in the tree—it’ll highlight that DOM node and show you the key prop in the right-hand pane.

You’ll now know which array and which component is still colliding.

2. Add a quick console.log in your .map()s
If you’re not sure DevTools is enough, you can temporarily sprinkle a console.log right before your return in each .map():

jsx
Copy
Edit
{/* in your ticker list: */}
{dashboardState.tickers.map((ticker, i) => {
  const key = `${ticker}-${i}`;
  console.log('Rendering ticker', ticker, 'with key', key);
  return (
    <button key={key} …>
      {ticker}
    </button>
  );
})}
Repeat for your activeCharts.map(...) and your events.map(...). When you reload, you’ll see exactly which values and indices are being used—and you’ll spot duplicates immediately.

3. Fix or reassign keys
Once you’ve identified where the dupes come from:

Use a truly unique field on your data if you have one (e.g. signal.id, chart.symbol, etc.) rather than an index.

Generate and persist a UUID on first load if no unique field exists. For example, when you fetch your tickers you could do:

js
Copy
Edit
fetch('/api/tickers')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(arr => {
    // map each ticker to an object with its own stable UUID:
    const withIds = arr.map((t) => ({ id: generateId(), symbol: t }));
    setDashboardState(s => ({ ...s, tickers: withIds }));
  });
Then in JSX:

jsx
Copy
Edit
{dashboardState.tickers.map(t => (
  <button key={t.id} onClick={() => handleSubscribeTicker(t.symbol)}>
    {t.symbol}
  </button>
))}
Avoid using bare objects as children: wherever you do {someObject} in JSX, wrap it in a string conversion (JSON.stringify(someObject)) or extract its fields.

TL;DR
Discover the list via React DevTools or console.logs in each .map().

Switch from index-based or duplicate-generated keys to a stable unique (an id property or a one-time UUID).

Ensure every child in your JSX is either a string/number or a valid React element—never raw objects.

That will eliminate the warnings once and for all. Let me know if you need help wiring up the UUID step!
