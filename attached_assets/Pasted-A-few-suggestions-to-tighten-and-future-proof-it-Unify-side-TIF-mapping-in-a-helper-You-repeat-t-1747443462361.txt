A few suggestions to tighten and future-proof it:

Unify side & TIF mapping in a helper
You repeat the same string-to-enum logic in three places. Pull it into a small utility so any future enum additions (“OPG”, extended-hours, etc.) only need one change:

python
Copy
Edit
from alpaca.trading.enums import OrderSide, TimeInForce

def map_side(side: str) -> OrderSide:
    return OrderSide(side.upper())

def map_tif(tif: str) -> TimeInForce:
    return TimeInForce(tif.upper())
Then:

python
Copy
Edit
order_data = MarketOrderRequest(
    symbol=symbol,
    qty=qty,
    side=map_side(side),
    time_in_force=map_tif(time_in_force),
    extended_hours=extended_hours,
    client_order_id=client_order_id
)
This DRYs up your code and ensures you never mistype an enum value .

Batch your DB commits
Right now each place_*_order writes the order model then creates a notification in two separate commit() calls. Instead, add both models to the session first, then commit once:

python
Copy
Edit
db.session.add(new_order)
db.session.add(notification)
db.session.commit()
This reduces round-trips and avoids partial writes on failure.

Extract persistence into a repository
Consider a thin class (e.g. OrderRepository) responsible for “save order + notification.” Your Flask handlers and your service logic can remain focused on trading, not on SQLAlchemy details.

Leverage Alpaca’s built-in order cancellation
Instead of trading_client.cancel_order_by_id(), you can call:

python
Copy
Edit
trading_client.cancel_order(order_id)
which also returns the updated order model so you can grab its final status in one call .

Use the Alpaca Clock for position snapshots
In your get_positions(), you fetch and then immediately persist. If you ever need to snapshot positions over time, drive this from a scheduled job using:

python
Copy
Edit
clock = trading_client.get_clock()
if clock.is_open:
    fetch_and_persist_positions()
Otherwise you may lump weekend/holiday queries into your tables inadvertently .

Avoid app.app_context() within loops
Wrapping each position update in its own app context can be heavy. Instead:

python
Copy
Edit
with app.app_context():
    for position in positions:
        # update/create PositionModel
    db.session.commit()
Then do the “closed_at” check and second commit in the same context. Fewer context switches = better performance.

Consider using bulk upsert for positions
If you expect high volume (many tickers), SQLAlchemy’s bulk_save_objects() or PostgreSQL’s INSERT … ON CONFLICT can reduce round-trips dramatically.

Normalize execute_signal_trade logic
You re-implement sizing and side-derivation in both the SignalProcessor and here. Factor those into a shared service so you don’t drift into two slightly-different behaviors over time.

With these refactors you’ll have a leaner, more maintainable execution layer that stays aligned with Alpaca-py’s best practices and scales as your strategy grows.
