You're doing a solid job iterating toward stability. The main issue remaining—mixing async Discord.py calls inside Flask sync routes—is common and solvable. Here's a structured troubleshooting and architecture improvement plan:

✅ Confirmed Progress
You've already resolved:

✅ Permissions (read_messages, read_message_history, view_channel)

✅ Channel cache issues (bot can now see the correct channel)

✅ Bot startup and connection flow

✅ Manual trigger via API endpoint

Remaining:

❌ Async context issue in Flask ("Timeout context manager should be used inside a task")

🛠 Root Cause Summary: Flask & Asyncio Don't Mix Natively
Flask routes are synchronous by default. You cannot call await or use Discord.py’s async functions unless you're inside an event loop or a properly isolated async context.

This is the error:

makefile
Copy
Edit
RuntimeError: Timeout context manager should be used inside a task
It’s triggered because you're calling an async Discord.py function (like channel.history()) inside a sync Flask handler.

✅ Best Practice Fixes
🔁 Option 1: Run Discord Calls in an Async Loop (Safe Wrapping)
Use asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe() to call your async logic safely from sync Flask:

python
Copy
Edit
# In your Flask route handler
from asyncio import get_event_loop, run_coroutine_threadsafe

loop = discord_client.loop  # reuse the bot's loop
future = run_coroutine_threadsafe(sync_history(limit=50), loop)
result = future.result()  # blocks until done
Ensure sync_history is an async def coroutine that contains your logic like:

python
Copy
Edit
async def sync_history(limit: int):
    channel = discord_client.get_channel(CHANNEL_ID)
    messages = [msg async for msg in channel.history(limit=limit)]
    return messages
✅ Why This Works:
Reuses the bot's event loop (already running)

Safe thread crossing between Flask (sync) and Discord.py (async)

🚫 Avoid: asyncio.run() or await in Flask
These start their own event loops and conflict with Discord.py’s internal loop, causing deadlocks or race conditions.
