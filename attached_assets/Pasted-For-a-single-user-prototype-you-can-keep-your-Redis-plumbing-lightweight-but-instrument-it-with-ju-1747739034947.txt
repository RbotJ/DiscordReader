For a single‐user prototype, you can keep your Redis plumbing lightweight, but instrument it with just enough metrics so that when you hit friction, you’ll know it’s time to graduate from simple Pub/Sub into a more durable design.

1. Prototype Redis Pattern
Pub/Sub only

Keep using publish_event / subscribe_to_channel.

Skip Streams and consumer groups for now.

In-Memory Fallback

Continue your DummyRedisClient in case Redis is unreachable.

No need for dead-letter queues at this stage.

Basic Cache

cache_set / cache_get with 30 min–1 hr TTL for parsed setups.

No “refresh-ahead” logic yet—just track misses.

2. Essential Metrics to Watch
Embed a light Prometheus client in your Redis helper (or use any in-process counter):

python
Copy
Edit
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, start_http_server

# start a metrics endpoint
start_http_server(8000)

# Redis operation metrics
REDIS_EVENTS_PUBLISHED = Counter(
    'proto_redis_events_published_total', 'Events published to Redis')
REDIS_EVENTS_FAILED = Counter(
    'proto_redis_events_failed_total', 'Redis publish failures')
REDIS_SUBSCRIBE_ERRORS = Counter(
    'proto_redis_subscribe_errors_total', 'Errors in subscription callbacks')
REDIS_PUBLISH_LATENCY = Histogram(
    'proto_redis_publish_latency_seconds', 'Redis publish round‐trip time')

CACHE_HITS = Counter('proto_cache_hits_total', 'cache_get successes')
CACHE_MISSES = Counter('proto_cache_misses_total', 'cache_get misses')
Event Counters

proto_redis_events_published_total

proto_redis_events_failed_total

Latency Histogram

proto_redis_publish_latency_seconds to see if Redis calls are slowing down.

Cache Hit/Miss

proto_cache_hits_total, proto_cache_misses_total

Expose these on http://localhost:8000/metrics and hook Grafana (or curl) to alert when:

Failures spike (e.g. > 1/min).

Publish latency regularly exceeds, say, 100 ms.

Cache miss ratio climbs above, say, 30 % (indicates you’re rebuilding parsed setups too often).

3. Prototype “Health” Gauge
Add a simple gauge for “pending messages”:

python
Copy
Edit
from prometheus_client import Gauge

# If you ever buffer events in a local queue:
LOCAL_QUEUE_SIZE = Gauge('proto_local_queue_size', 'In‐process event backlog size')
Increment/decrement it around your in-memory buffer; if it grows (you can’t publish fast enough), that’s an early warning to switch to Redis Streams.

4. When to Evolve
Use your metrics as triggers:

High publish failures or callback errors → add retry/backoff logic.

Rising publish latency → enable connection pooling or Sentinel.

Local queue growing → migrate to Redis Streams + consumer groups.

Frequent cache misses → introduce refresh-ahead or a hot-key pattern.

5. Next Steps
Wire up the Prometheus metrics client in redis_utils.py and in your cache helpers.

Run your prototype under real data for a day or two.

Observe the metrics dashboard—set simple alerts via Grafana or a script.

Refine: once you hit any warning thresholds, decide which durability feature (Streams, DLQs, retry policies) to adopt next.

This approach lets you move fast for a single user, but surface quantitative signals so you only add complexity when you really need it.
