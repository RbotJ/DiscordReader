WARNING - Cannot poll events outside Flask application context
indicates that your event polling logic is trying to access Flask-specific resources (e.g. current_app, DB session, config) without an active Flask application context.

‚úÖ Resolution Strategy
1. Wrap event polling in an app context:

If you are polling events from outside a Flask route or CLI command, you need to manually push the app context:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import current_app

def start_polling():
    from your_flask_app import create_app
    app = create_app()
    with app.app_context():
        poll_events()
This ensures your polling function can access things like current_app.config, DB sessions, and loggers.

üîç Additional Things to Check
A. Who is calling poll_events()?
Make sure you're not calling poll_events() directly from a script or background thread without wrapping it in the context shown above.

B. Thread Safety / Context Handling
If you're using threading, asyncio, or background schedulers like APScheduler, each thread or coroutine may require its own Flask app context.

C. Celery Worker Setup
If your event consumer runs as a background job via Celery, configure Celery to push the Flask context into each task:

python
Copy
Edit
from celery import Task
from your_flask_app import create_app

class ContextTask(Task):
    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        with create_app().app_context():
            return self.run(*args, **kwargs)

celery.Task = ContextTask
üß™ Diagnostic Enhancements
To make the problem more obvious in logs:

python
Copy
Edit
from flask import has_app_context
if not has_app_context():
    logger.warning("Polling attempted without app context!")
üí° Bonus Recommendations
Move event consumer into a CLI script (e.g. flask events consume) to leverage Flask‚Äôs CLI context.

Use flask.current_app.logger instead of global loggers for better context-aware logging.

Check that polling intervals don't outlive the app context, especially in while True loops or daemons.
