Here are a few proven tricks to pin down whether you‚Äôre actually launching the code you think you are, and get that ‚Äúbot connected‚Äù log to appear:

1. Add a ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù print at module import
At the very top of your main.py (or whatever file you think is the entry point), drop in:

print(f"‚ñ∂Ô∏è  Starting DiscordReader from {__file__}")
Then run your launch command. If you never see that line, you know you‚Äôre executing some other script.

2. Log out the Bot class location
Inside your bot subclass (e.g. in class TradingDiscordBot), add in the constructor or at class‚Äêdefinition time:

import os, logging
logging.getLogger().info(
    f"ü§ñ  Instantiating Bot from {TradingDiscordBot.__module__!r} @ {os.path.abspath(__file__)}"
)
(or simply print(TradingDiscordBot.__module__, __file__))
That way, once you do bot = TradingDiscordBot(...), you‚Äôll see exactly which file path and module is being used.

3. Verify your ‚Äúrun‚Äù invocation
Are you doing:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bot.run(os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"))
‚Ä¶ or are you accidentally calling an old script, or using flask run with FLASK_APP=some_old_module?

If you use flask run, check echo $FLASK_APP.
If you do python main.py, make sure you‚Äôre in the project root and that there isn‚Äôt another main.py earlier on your PYTHONPATH.
4. Check for a stale ‚Äúinstalled‚Äù copy
If at any point you did pip install . or pip install -e ., you may have an older version sitting in your site-packages.
Run:

pip uninstall DiscordReader
pip uninstall discordreader   # try both name variants
Then re-launch from your local folder.

5. Simplify to a minimal repro
Create a tiny script test_bot.py in your project root:

import discord, os, logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

print("‚Üí test_bot.py at", __file__)
bot = discord.Client(intents=discord.Intents.default())
bot.run(os.getenv("DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"))
Run it with python test_bot.py. If that never logs in, you know the problem is either your token or your environment‚Äîat least it rules out any complexity in your larger app.
