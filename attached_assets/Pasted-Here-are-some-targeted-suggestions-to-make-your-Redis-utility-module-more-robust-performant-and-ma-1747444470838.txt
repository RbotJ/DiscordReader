Here are some targeted suggestions to make your Redis utility module more robust, performant, and maintainable:

Swap manual fallback arrays for collections.deque

python
Copy
Edit
from collections import defaultdict, deque
_fallback_messages: Dict[str, deque] = defaultdict(lambda: deque(maxlen=MAX_FALLBACK_MESSAGES))
A deque with maxlen automatically drops old messages, so you don’t need to slice lists each publish.

Use queue.Queue for per-subscriber queues
Instead of managing your own message_queue list plus a lock, you can simplify thread-safety by:

python
Copy
Edit
from queue import Queue, Empty
self.message_queue: Queue = Queue()
and then in get_message():

python
Copy
Edit
try:
    return self.message_queue.get(timeout=timeout)
except Empty:
    return None
This removes explicit locks and makes your fallback PubSub simpler.

Avoid trying to auto-start Redis via subprocess
Starting Redis from your app risks hanging or permission issues. Instead rely on your container/orchestration (Docker Compose, systemd, Kubernetes) to manage Redis. You can remove _start_redis_server() and ensure_redis_is_running(), and simply log a warning if Redis is down.

Reuse a single redis.ConnectionPool
Each RedisClient currently does redis.from_url(), which creates a new connection pool. Consider making the pool a module-level singleton so every RedisClient shares it and you don’t exhaust connections:

python
Copy
Edit
_pool = redis.ConnectionPool.from_url(REDIS_URL)
client = redis.Redis(connection_pool=_pool)
Leverage Redis-Py’s built-in run_in_thread for Pub/Sub
Rather than polling with get_message(timeout) + sleep(0.01), you can:

python
Copy
Edit
pubsub = client.pubsub()
pubsub.subscribe(**{channel: callback})
thread = pubsub.run_in_thread(sleep_time=0.1)
This hands off message dispatch to Redis-Py, reduces CPU churn, and cleans up subscriptions automatically.

Restore fallback “get” and “set” semantics
Currently get() in fallback mode always returns None. If you want your app to continue working in-memory, implement:

python
Copy
Edit
if self.fallback_mode:
    return fallback_store.get(key)
and similarly for set(), so that reads/writes still operate when Redis is down.

Isolate fallback logic into its own module/class
Right now your RedisClient mixes real Redis, fallback pub/sub, and fallback get/set. Extract a separate InMemoryRedis implementation that shares the same interface. Then RedisClient can simply wrap either a real or in-memory client, rather than branching on self.fallback_mode everywhere.

Parameterize host/port/db via constructor or environment
Rather than hard-coding REDIS_HOST, REDIS_PORT, REDIS_DB, let users pass them in, or at least read them from the url parameter. This makes your module more reusable in different environments.

Graceful shutdown of subscriber threads
You set self.running = False in unsubscribe, but there’s no way to tell your background subscription loop to exit. Consider adding a public close() method on FallbackPubSub (and on real PubSub thread) that cleanly unsubscribes and stops any thread loops.

Add type hints and docstrings for clarity
Most of your methods lack return type annotations. Adding -> bool, -> Optional[str], etc., helps with IDE autocompletion and static analysis.

By adopting these changes you’ll get:

Automatic fallback trimming via deque

Cleaner thread-safe queues via queue.Queue

Less CPU busy-waiting via run_in_thread

Simpler, testable fallback logic by isolating it

Greater configurability for real-world deployments

This will make your Redis utilities both leaner and far more reliable in production.
