📁 Recommended /common Directory Structure
A well-structured /common directory serves as the foundation for shared infrastructure and utilities across your vertical slices. Here's a suggested organization:

bash
Copy
Edit
/common
├── events/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── models.py          # SQLAlchemy Event model
│   ├── publisher.py       # publish_event(), flush_event_buffer()
│   ├── consumer.py        # get_events_by_channel(), polling helpers
│   └── constants.py       # EventChannels, EventTypes enums
├── db/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── session.py         # SQLAlchemy session management
│   └── migrations/        # Alembic migration scripts
├── logging/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── logger.py          # Logging configuration and utilities
├── config/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── settings.py        # Application configuration management
├── utils/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── helpers.py         # Miscellaneous utility functions
└── middleware/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── error_handler.py   # Global error handling middleware
This structure promotes clear separation of concerns and facilitates easy navigation and maintenance.

🔍 Detailed Recommendations
1. Consolidate Event Handling in /common/events
Ensure that all event-related logic resides within the /common/events directory. This includes:

Event Model: Define a single Event model in models.py to represent events in your PostgreSQL event bus.

Publishing Utilities: Implement functions like publish_event() in publisher.py to standardize event emission.

Consumption Utilities: Provide functions in consumer.py to retrieve and process events.

Constants: Maintain event channel and type definitions in constants.py for consistency.

This consolidation aligns with VSA by centralizing cross-cutting concerns, reducing redundancy, and enhancing maintainability.

2. Enhance Database Session Management
In /common/db/session.py, implement a robust session management system:

python
Copy
Edit
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
This setup ensures consistent database interactions across your application.

3. Implement Centralized Logging
Create a logging configuration in /common/logging/logger.py:

python
Copy
Edit
import logging

def setup_logger(name: str) -> logging.Logger:
    logger = logging.getLogger(name)
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
    # Configure handlers, formatters, etc.
    return logger
Centralized logging facilitates easier debugging and monitoring.

4. Manage Configuration Settings
Utilize /common/config/settings.py to manage application settings:

python
Copy
Edit
import os

class Settings:
    DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("DATABASE_URL", "sqlite:///./test.db")
    # Add other settings as needed

settings = Settings()
This approach centralizes configuration, making it easier to manage different environments.

5. Provide Utility Functions
In /common/utils/helpers.py, include reusable utility functions that can be shared across slices, such as date formatting, data validation, etc.

6. Implement Global Error Handling
Create middleware in /common/middleware/error_handler.py to handle exceptions globally, ensuring consistent error responses and logging.

✅ Summary of Benefits
Improvement Area	Benefit
Consolidated Event Handling	Reduces redundancy and enhances maintainability
Centralized DB Management	Ensures consistent database interactions
Unified Logging	Simplifies debugging and monitoring
Central Config Management	Eases environment-specific configurations
Shared Utilities	Promotes code reuse and DRY principles
Global Error Handling	Provides consistent error responses

Implementing these recommendations will align your /common directory with Vertical Slice Architecture principles, promoting a more modular, maintainable, and scalable codebase.
