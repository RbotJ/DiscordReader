erify Discord Bot Enhancements (Unit Tests, Logging, Uptime, Rate-Limit Handling)

🎯 Objective:
Verify that the following enhancements to the features/discord_bot/ slice were fully and correctly implemented. This is a read-only audit — do not make changes. For each item, report where and how it was implemented, and if anything is missing.

✅ Checklist of Items to Verify
1. Unit Tests Added

File: tests/features/discord_bot/test_bot.py
Confirm the existence of tests for:
on_ready() — e.g., test_on_ready_logs_connection
_trigger_ingestion() — e.g., test_trigger_ingestion_publishes_event
Note whether mocks were used (e.g., mock.AsyncMock, patch)
Confirm pytest-asyncio or equivalent is used for async tests
2. Structured Logging in on_message()

File: features/discord_bot/bot.py
Confirm presence of logging like:
"Received message from" with author and channel info
"Triggering ingestion for message ID" before calling _trigger_ingestion
Note if logs use logger.info vs logger.debug, and whether structured logging (e.g., JSON-style) is used
3. Uptime Metric or Heartbeat

File(s): bot.py, api.py
Confirm _start_time is set in the bot class (e.g., self._start_time = datetime.utcnow())
Confirm /api/discord/status includes uptime_seconds or heartbeat_ts
4. Rate-Limit Warning Logs

File: features/discord_bot/bot.py
Confirm an event handler exists for on_rate_limit or similar
Confirm it logs warning-level messages when Discord rate limits are encountered
📦 Output Format
Please return the results like this:

### 🔍 Discord Bot Enhancement Verification

#### ✅ Unit Tests
✔ test_on_ready_logs_connection exists with mock objects
✔ test_trigger_ingestion_publishes_event uses patch on publish_event_async

#### ✅ Structured Logging
✔ on_message() logs message receipt and ingestion trigger with logger.info

#### ✅ Uptime / Heartbeat
✔ self._start_time initialized in bot.py
✔ /api/discord/status returns uptime_seconds

#### ✅ Rate-Limit Logs
✔ on_rate_limit event handler logs retry_after and bucket info

### 🟢 All enhancements verified successfully
