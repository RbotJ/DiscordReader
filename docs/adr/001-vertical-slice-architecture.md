# ADR 001: Vertical Slice Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

When designing the A+ Trading App, we needed to decide on an architectural approach that would:

1. Support the complex domain of trading systems
2. Allow for independent development and deployment of features
3. Keep related code together for better maintainability
4. Avoid the typical problems of layered architectures, such as tight coupling and rigid dependencies

We considered several architectural approaches, including:

- Traditional N-tier layered architecture (UI, Services, Data)
- Microservices architecture
- Domain-Driven Design with Clean Architecture
- Vertical Slice Architecture

## Decision

We have decided to adopt a **Vertical Slice Architecture** for the A+ Trading App.

In this architecture:

- Code is organized by feature rather than by technical layer
- Each feature contains all the code needed to implement that feature, from UI to data access
- Features communicate via events (Redis pub/sub) rather than direct references
- Common code is extracted to shared libraries only when needed by multiple features

Key aspects of our implementation:

```
/features/
  /setups/         # Feature: Setup ingestion and parsing
  /market/         # Feature: Market data monitoring
  /strategy/       # Feature: Trading strategy detection
  /options_selector/   # Feature: Options contract selection
  /execution/      # Feature: Trade execution
  /management/     # Feature: Position management
  /notifications/  # Feature: User notifications
```

Each feature directory contains all the code needed for that feature, including:
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- Data access
- Tests

## Consequences

Positive:

- Improved developer productivity by keeping related code together
- Easier to understand and work on a feature without understanding the entire system
- Better isolation between features, reducing unintended side effects
- Support for parallel development by different teams
- Simplified deployment of individual features
- More natural alignment with how users think about the application

Negative:

- Potential for code duplication across features
- Need for careful event design to manage communication between features
- Requires discipline to maintain feature boundaries
- May be unfamiliar to developers accustomed to layered architectures

## Implementation Details

Our implementation of Vertical Slice Architecture will use:

1. **Redis pub/sub** for event-driven communication between features
2. **Feature folders** containing all code for a specific feature
3. **Common libraries** for truly shared functionality (models, utilities)
4. **Independent testing** of each feature

This approach will allow us to develop, test, and deploy features independently, leading to faster development cycles and more maintainable code.
