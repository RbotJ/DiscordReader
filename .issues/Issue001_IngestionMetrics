Last Message Published (Discord Timestamp)

Most recent message as seen by the bot.

Indicates feed freshness from Discord.

Last Message Stored (DB Insert Timestamp)

Latest successful DB write timestamp.

Indicates ingestion process health.

Message Delay Histogram

Bar chart or bins showing how long messages waited before ingestion.

Separate into:

Structural failures (missing lines, unreadable formats)

Semantic mismatches (bad dates, unknown tickers)

Duplicate Detection Count
